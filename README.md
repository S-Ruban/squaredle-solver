# squaredle-solver
A python script that gets the daily Squaredle board and finds possible words.

Uses the ```pyjsparser``` library to parse the JavaScript file into a ```.json``` file, then extracts the daily board from the json file and finally compares words with the English Dictionary using the ```english_words``` library.
